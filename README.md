# blockscribe
Block Scribe: Currently a work in progress, but it inspires to be what was once a plugin for bukkit servers to log all events block place block break and any other interactions including interactions with machines and inventories as well as lava and fire spread events and even logging clicking of flint and steel tools and such.  It would then save these interactions into either flat file or an sql db

I plan on it having same functionality just in mod format
This is a project of my free time and with the use of an AI Goggle : Gemini.

I have a little experience with java, haven't had much success with it but I am still trying to learn as best I can.

I will clean up this read me once I get more things done and start getting these files wrote out.

Thanks again for taking a look at this read me.

Your Friend,
